{{% color "#3498db" %}}**Ph.D. students**{{% /color %}} I am always looking for creative, self-motivated and hardworking graduate students who want to pursue a PhD degree by working with me on networked systems, systems security, online privacy, and measurement. Solid background of computer science, with strength in system building, data analysis, and usable theory are required. If interested in joining our group, please do the following. 1) Read 2-3 papers of my recent publications (from the past 2 years) to make sure that you are interested in what we do, 2) Apply to our Ph.D. program, 3) send me a brief summary of your background and a CV (PDF or txt files only!), a summary of the 2-3 papers you read, and what you liked about them. In the title of your first email, put {{% color "red" %}}**Potential Phd Student**{{% /color %}} to know that you have read this note.

{{% color "#3498db" %}}**M.Sc. students**{{% /color %}} I have research projects for M.Sc. thesis students. If you are a self-motivated and hardworking student at UALR and would like to work on a cool research project in the above areas, consider taking course XXX, offered in the Spring and Fall, if you did not do that already, and send me an email to find a time to talk.

{{% color "#3498db" %}}**Undergraduate students**{{% /color %}} Undergraduate students interested in working in our group should first consider taking computer security. Students with solid computer science background and skills (i.e., programming, algorithms, analysis, hacking, and curiosity) should contact me to setup a time to discuss potential projects.
