      <description>Details of the publication Republican businessman Greg Gianforte won Montana’s sole House district in a special election Thursday, keeping a seat in Republican hands despite facing assault charges for allegedly attacking a reporter who’d asked him about the GOP’s health-care bill.
In his victory speech, Gianforte admitted to the attack and apologized for it.
“I shouldn’t have treated that reporter that way,” he told supporters at his rally here.</description>
