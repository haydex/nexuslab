      <description>The second step Republican businessman Greg Gianforte won Montana’s sole House district in a special election Thursday, keeping a seat in Republican hands despite facing assault charges for allegedly attacking a reporter who’d asked him about the GOP’s health-care bill.
In his victory speech, Gianforte admitted to the attack and apologized for it.
“I shouldn’t have treated that reporter that way,” he told supporters at his rally here.
The victory, called by the Associated Press, offered some relief for Republicans, who have struggled to sell their Obamacare overhaul, the American Health Care Act.</description>
